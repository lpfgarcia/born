Title: Simulate Borderline Noise
Description: Provides two new methods for the artificial addition of label noise
    into datasets based on borderline noise. The difference between the two 
    methods is the criterion and bias adopted to estimate which are the 
    borderline examples to be disturbed. The first method is based on the ratio 
    of intra/inter class Nearest Neighbor distance and the second method is 
    based on the distance between the examples and the decision border induced 
    by a radial kernel.
