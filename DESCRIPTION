Title: Generate Borderline Noise for Classification Problems
Description: Provides new methods for the artificial addition of label noise in 
    the borderline examples to add more challenging and yet realistic artificial
    noise to classification datasets. The main difference between the methods is
    the criterion and bias adopted to estimate which are the borderline examples
    to be disturbed: the first method is based on the ratio of intra/inter class
    Nearest Neighbor distance and the second method is based on the distance 
    between the examples and the decision border induced by a radial kernel.
